            How do I begin? <br>
            How do I cope? <br>
            Some people sin <br>
            Some people don't <br>
            What we had was thin <br>
            So we couldn't survive <br>
            Bad times can win <br>
            While good things can die <br>
        </p>

            I was the hero, but you get the glory <br>
            Now I'm the villain inside of your story <br>
            I was the saint, you used to adore me <br>
            Now I'm the villain inside of your story <br>
        </p>

            You're walking through Heaven <br>
            I'm walking through flames <br>
            This can't be mended <br>
            It won't be the same <br>
            Thank you for nothing (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) <br>
            Thanks for the pain (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) <br>
            This is what love brings (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) <br>
            Maybe I'll wait (ooh-ooh, ooh) <br>

            Oh-oh-oh, ooh <br>
            I bled, I bled for free <br>
            Oh-oh-oh, ooh <br>
            Your wretched victory <br>
            Oh-oh-oh, ooh <br>
            I bled, I bled for free <br>
            Oh-oh-oh, ooh <br>
            Gave every part of me <br>
