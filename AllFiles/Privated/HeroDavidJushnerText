        How do I begin?
        How do I cope?
        Some people sin
        Some people don't
        What we had was thin
        So we couldn't survive
        Bad times can win
        While good things can die

        I was the hero, but you get the glory
        Now I'm the villain inside of your story
        I was the saint, you used to adore me
        Now I'm the villain inside of your story

        You're walking through Heaven
        I'm walking through flames
        This can't be mended
        It won't be the same
        Thank you for nothing (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
        Thanks for the pain (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
        This is what love brings (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
        Maybe I'll wait (ooh-ooh, ooh)

        I was the hero, but you get the glory
        Now I'm the villain inside of your story
        I was the saint, you used to adore me
        Now I'm the villain inside of your story
        Oh-oh-oh, ooh
        I bled, I bled for free
        Oh-oh-oh, ooh
        Your wretched victory
        Oh-oh-oh, ooh
        I bled, I bled for free
        Oh-oh-oh, ooh
        Gave every part of me

        I was the hero, but you get the glory
        Now I'm the villain inside of your story
        I was the saint, you used to adore me
        Now I'm the villain inside of your story
        I was the hero, but you get the glory
        Now I'm the villain inside of your story
        I was the saint, you used to adore me
        Now I'm the villain inside of your story
